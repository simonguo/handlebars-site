      Handlebar's npm package includes both libraries suitable for CommonJS aware systems
      and built browser libraries that can be consumed direct browser mechanisms.

    :highlight_plain
      npm install --save handlebars

    .notes
      Require-aware systems such as Node and Webpack can then load via:

    :javascript
      require('handlebars');

    .notes
      or for the runtime only:

    :javascript
      require('handlebars/runtime');

      The browser builds are located in the <code>node_modules/handlebars/dist/</code> directory. Making these accessible to the browser will depend on what build system you are using but this may be as simple as copying the files to an acessible place.

    .notes
      This is the preferred method of installation when using the precompiler as it ensures that your precompiled templates always run against the same version of the runtime.

%h2#bower
  Bower

      Handlebars maintains a <a href="https://github.com/components/handlebars.js">bower component</a> as well that is available for <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a> users. This can be installed in a project like so.

    :highlight_plain
      bower install --save handlebars

    .notes
      The default bower library is UMD-style so this should work properly with global, CJS, and AMD module systems. <code>handlebars.js</code> and <code>handlebars.runtime.js</code> are the primary source files but a number of other options exist in this component. We recommend looking at them and selecting the best one for your needs.

    .notes
      This component should also work with other packagers such as <a href="https://github.com/componentjs/component">component</a> but these have not been tested as throughly.

%h2#download
  Manual Download

    .description
      All of Handlebar's released versions and CI builds are available for download on S3 in our <a href="http://builds.handlebarsjs.com.s3.amazonaws.com/bucket-listing.html?sort=lastmod&sortdir=desc">builds page</a>.

    .notes
      The latest passing master build is named <code>handlebars-latest.js</code> and each passing SHA on master will create a <code>handlebars-gitSHA.js</code> file. While these all pass the CI, it's preferrable to use one fo the tagged releases.

    .notes
      **Note**: The S3 builds page is provided as a convenience for the community, but you should not use it for hosting Handlebars in production.
